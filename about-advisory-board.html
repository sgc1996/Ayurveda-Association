                                            <p><span class="article">My journey with Ayurveda began in the 1970’s with meditation, learning the terms ‘satva’, ‘rajas’ and ‘tamas’ as doorways to observing my mind’s cycles. In 1986, I had the great good fortune to meet with Dr. Robert Svoboda, who had just published his first book in India and was touring Canada to begin his teaching mission.</span><span class="moretext"> He suggested I meet his teacher, Vaidya Vasant D. Lad. Right from hearing his name, I knew my destiny was involved and subsequent met him by divine grace in 1989, beginning a diligent and compelling apprenticeship with Dr. Lad for 12 years. Still today, I continue studying Ayurveda with him and all teachers, such as clients, students, colleagues, scholars, the environment and my own inner changes. During the 1990’s, the late and beloved Dr. Thricovil Sukumaran became a most significant influence in my understanding of Ayurveda, especially Kerala style panchakarma. I was also privileged to work on the inception of the National Ayurveda Association in the US, where I was learning, practicing and teaching at the time, becoming a founding member. Returning to Canada in 2007 for undertaking my father’s end of life care, I became very interested in Ayurveda Geriatrics. Now in my 70’s, my goal is to serve through Ayurveda, whose wisdom was generated for alleviating suffering and becoming one’s true Self. Some of my goals as an advisor to the Board of Directors are to support the A.A.C. purposes of unity, consumer guidance, continuing education, government interface and ethical practice of the sacred and comprehensive science of Ayurveda. Of particular interest to me are the goals of implementing AYUSH International Standards of Practice, securing practitioner insurance coverage and supporting importation of all tried and true Ayurvedic medicinal substances. All of us will be needed to realize these lofty goals, and I plan to contribute what I can to our successes, with the grace of the Board and membership.</span></p>

(based in New York City): is a certified holistic Ayurvedic Wellness and Spiritual Healing Coach, accredited by the AADP, with a focus on mind-body-spirit well-being.</span><span class="moretext"> She has completed her training in the time-honored science of Ayurveda under a renowned Ayurvedacharya learning about the health issues faced in the US and India. In addition, she has studied at the reputed Institute of Integrative Integration, where she was trained in a variety of lifestyle coaching methods. Her knowledge in spiritual healing has been gained by learning from a guru (who has since taken Samadhi); and exploring various spiritual/energy healing modalities through different training programs and books. She is passionate about spreading the knowledge of Ayurveda, Healing, and Spirituality globally; and towards this aim, she has created a practical ‘Rise like a Phoenix’ Coaching program at Vedic Synergy for mind-body-soul transformation. The program aims to support the audience on the most important journey of life – to one’s Higher Consciousness or ‘I AM’ – that will result in higher vibration, joy, and fulfillment. Along with this, she holds group workshops on Ayurveda, cooking with spices, and meditation. Vishnupriya grew up with conventional medicine (her father was a doctor) during her childhood in India; through which she got insight into the human body, ailments, and most importantly compassion for those looking to heal. In her mid-twenties, she moved to New York City where she has had an extensive corporate career spanning 20 years across the Investment Banking and Technology/Business arenas, which provided her with an in-depth understanding of the stresses that are faced by working professionals. Her diverse experience, knowledge, and empathy, makes her a suitable bridge from the mainstream to holistic healing. The mission of Vedic Synergy (www.vedicsynergy.com) is to spread this gift of Ayurveda and Spiritual healing that we have received from the ancients across geographical borders, and thereby contribute to raising the positive global soul energy.</span></p>
