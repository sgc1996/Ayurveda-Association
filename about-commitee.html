                                            </span><span class="moretext">
                                                She has completed her training in the time-honored science of Ayurveda under a renowned Ayurvedacharya learning about the health issues faced in the US and India. In addition, she has studied at the reputed Institute of Integrative Integration, where she was trained in a variety of lifestyle coaching methods. Her knowledge in spiritual healing has been gained by learning from a guru (who has since taken Samadhi); and exploring various spiritual/energy healing modalities through different training programs and books.<br>

She is passionate about spreading the knowledge of Ayurveda, Healing, and Spirituality globally; and towards this aim, she has created a practical ‘Rise like a Phoenix’ Coaching program at Vedic Synergy for mind-body-soul transformation. The program aims to support the audience on the most important journey of life – to one’s Higher Consciousness or ‘I AM’ – that will result in higher vibration, joy, and fulfillment. Along with this, she holds group workshops on Ayurveda, cooking with spices, and meditation.<br>

Vishnupriya grew up with conventional medicine (her father was a doctor) during her childhood in India; through which she got insight into the human body, ailments, and most importantly compassion for those looking to heal. In her mid-twenties, she moved to New York City where she has had an extensive corporate career spanning 20 years across the Investment Banking and Technology/Business arenas, which provided her with an in-depth understanding of the stresses that are faced by working professionals. Her diverse experience, knowledge, and empathy, makes her a suitable bridge from the mainstream to holistic healing.<br>

The mission of Vedic Synergy (www.vedicsynergy.com) is to spread this gift of Ayurveda and Spiritual healing that we have received from the ancients across geographical borders, and thereby contribute to raising the positive global soul energy.</span></p>

As part of his mission to propagate knowledge about Ayurveda, he has also founded the Ayurveda Mantra Magazine, for which he serves as the editor-in-chief, and through which he seeks to generate awareness about Ayurveda and natural well-being among a global readership.</span><span class="moretext"> <br>
                                                Paul has been a long-standing proponent of Ayurveda and natural well-being. For nearly two decades, he has actively engaged in promoting Ayurvedic products and building informed perspectives around the ancient sciences of Ayurveda and Yoga. Paul’s passion for Ayurveda stems from his first-hand association with the subject – an association that dates back to his early years. In 1998, he established Herbland Limited, an Ayurvedic products enterprise first headquartered in New York, USA, and eventually in Toronto, Canada.<br>

                                                Over the years, Paul has built lasting relationships within the Ayurveda community, along with a worldwide network of experts, scholars, teachers and practitioners in the fields of Ayurveda, Yoga and herbal remedies. He is currently based in Toronto and continues his advocacy of natural well-being through the Ayurveda Mantra Magazine, a bi-monthly repository of articles from Ayurveda and Yoga experts that he aims to publish in multiple languages.
